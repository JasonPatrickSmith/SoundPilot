SoundPilot is a music education web app created for the Exscore 2025 hackathon using HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, and MySQL.

There are 2 pages. The Student Page and the Teacher Page.
There is no way to switch between student accounts or teacher accounts. There is only one of each (demo accounts). This means that everyone accessing the teacher page will be on the same teacher account and the same goes for the student account/page.
To view the student page visit [Here](http://3.13.118.113/soundpilot/Client/pages/home.html).

SoundPilot is a desktop music education web app created for the Exscore 2025 hackathon using HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, and MySQL.
It is primarily meant to serve music students who normally cannot learn an instrument/music in person, such as students located in rural areas or disabled students.
It also serves teachers who may be high level musicians but are unable to teach in person due to a disability or geographical issue.
Soundpilot lets these individuals collaborate seamlessly.

There are 2 pages. The Student Page and the Teacher Page.
There is no way to switch between student accounts or teacher accounts. There is only one of each (demo accounts). This means that everyone accessing the teacher page will be on the same teacher account and the same goes for the student account/page.
To view the student page visit [Here](http://3.13.118.113/soundpilot/Client/pages/home.html).
To view the teacher page visit [Here](http://3.13.118.113/soundpilot/Client/pages/teacher.html).

Students can do music theory exercises and upload submissions for assignments of many types.
Teachers can see student's exercise progress, assign things, and view and comment on submissions.
